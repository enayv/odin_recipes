    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This perfect baked macaroni cheese recipe comes with a creamy cheese sauce, a 
        hint of mustard and uses leftover French stick for its crunchy topping</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>50g baguette, cut into small chunks</li> 
        <li>2 tbsp butter, plus 1 tbsp melted</li>  
        <li>350g spiral or other short pasta</li> 
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li> 
        <li>1 tsp English mustard powder</li> 
        <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>  
        <li>500ml whole milk</li>    
        <li>250g vegetarian mature cheddar, grated</li> 
        <li>50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), grated</li>  
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spread the baguette chunks over a baking sheet, 
            drizzle with the melted butter and season. Bake for 6 mins until crisp, then set aside</li>

        <li>Boil the pasta for 2 mins less than stated on the pack, then drain. Meanwhile, melt the
             butter in a saucepan. Add the garlic and English mustard powder, cook for 1 min, then
              stir in the plain flour.</li>

        <li>Cook for 1 min more, then gradually whisk in the milk until you have a lump-free 
            sauce. Simmer for 5 mins, whisking all the time until thickened. Take off the heat,
             then stir in the cheddar and half the parmesan.</li>

        <li>BStir the pasta and some seasoning into the cheesy sauce. Tip into a large ovenproof
             dish, or four individual dishes.</li>

        <li>HScatter over the bread and the remaining parmesan, then bake for 20 mins until crisp
             and golden. Can be frozen before baking – <i>defrost thoroughly before cooking.</i> </li>

        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some
             fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made
              or homemade white sauce.</li>

        <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white
             sauce, making sure you can’t see any pasta poking through.</li>

        <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>

        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is
             bubbling and lightly browned.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3><i>Recipe Tip</i></h3>
    <h4>USE UP BLUE CHEESE</h4>
    <p>Crumble 50g stilton, dolcelatte or roquefort into the sauce, instead of the parmesan.
         Spoon the pasta into the dish, then top with 4 trimmed field mushrooms, gills facing
          upwards, instead of the crumbs. Drizzle with a little oil, season, then top with a
           little more blue cheese. Bake as before.</p>
